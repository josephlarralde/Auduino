# Auduino

## The Lo-Fi granular synthesizer

This repository is a duplicate of Peter Knight's Auduino sketch for Uno boards.
Just a personal copy, as the links in the original file seem deprecated.
This code was found on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Auduino-Lo-fi-Synth-for-arduino/)

#### instructions

* Get yourself a Uno board, a piezo speaker and five 10k potentiometers
* Connect the speaker's red wire to pin 3, and the black wire to a GND pin
* Wire your pots to analog inputs A0 to A4 (see [this tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/AnalogInput))
* Upload the sketch to your Uno
* That's it !
